FCC_bug - a Repository to help find a bug in my Keras semantic segmentation code...

This code is for image segmentation, though here I've included only 10 image files and 10 masks. 

The problem seems to be the command:

    train_generator = zip(image_generator, mask_generator)

Upon excecuting this command, memory useage expands to the maximum possible, 
and then swapped memory increases to the max, and then everything freezes.

ADDENDUM: The problem is that with Python 2, the zip is trying to zip infinitely many items! Using Python 3 this problem wouldn't arise. The solution (if you're using Python 2) is to instead use the following command:

    train_generator = itertools.izip(image_generator, mask_generator)

The problematic command was used in the Keras documentation I was attempting to emulate, 
on this page:  https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/ , 

with the  heading:  "Example of transforming images and masks together."

NOTE: The code has been modified to use a custom iterator, rather than flow_from_directory.
      Now the code actually runs!
